### Why?

Attributes are a way to extend classes, methods, and properties in programming.  
You can think of attributes as annotations. They can enhance your enums, methods, or classes by providing additional functionality or behavior.  
Try adopting them, and who knows? Maybe you'll become a better developer in the process!
