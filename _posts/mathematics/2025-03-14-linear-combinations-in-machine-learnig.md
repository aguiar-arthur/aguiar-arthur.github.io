Linear combination is as process of combining a set of vectors using scalar (a real number ℝ or a complex number ℂ) multiplication and addition.

### First of all, what are vectors

 vectors are mathematical objects that represent quantities with both magnitude (size) and direction. In a linear combination, vectors are the "building blocks" that are scaled (multiplied by scalars) and added together to create new vectors.

For example, consider two vectors in 2D space:

$$v_ 1=\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
0 
\end{bmatrix},
v_2=\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
1 \\
\end{bmatrix}$$
